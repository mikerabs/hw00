How long did you spend on the assignment?

I probably spent about 8-10 hours on this assignment

What did you learn by doing this assignment?

A ton, mostly just how the pronunciation dictionary works and how to tokenize strings.  Lots of cool problem solving challenges in the rhyming function, though I wish I had planned out more beforehand.

Briefly describe a Computational Text Analysis/Text as Data research question where identifying if a poem is a limerick or not (keep this answer to a maximum of 3 sentences).
One research question could be could we write a machine learning model that could tell us whether a piece of text is a limerick or not based on supervised learning of limericks and non limericks?
We could try and make this program a little mor einteresting as slant rhymes are difficult to differentiate from real rhymes in code, so I think we could try and make a threshold rhyming constant
that we tell the model every rhyming pair must output a value above this given number for it to be considered a valid rhyme.


I liked this assignment a lot but would have appreciated more clear instructions on which functions we might be using within nltk since the references were kinda hard to understand,
and how to structure the rhymes() method on a basic level.
